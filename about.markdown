I am a PhD student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/grad).

#### Research Interest

I am broadly interested in topics that lie at the intersection between economics and computer science. In particular, I am interested in algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, and applied theory.

For my master's thesis, I set up a competition a la Hotelling between two Q-Learning Algorithms. My thesis seeks to understand whether two independent algorithms, unaware of each other, learning from realized outcomes, end up implementing a deviation and punishment scheme to sustain collusion.
