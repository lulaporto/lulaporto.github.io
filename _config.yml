# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

I am a PhD student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/grad).

- M.A. in Economics, 2022: Universidad de San Andres, Argentina

- B.A. in Economics, 2020: Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina

#### Research Interest

I am broadly interested in topics that lie at the intersection between economics and computer science. In particular, I am interested in algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, and applied theory.

For my master's thesis, I set up a competition a la Hotelling between two Q-Learning Algorithms. My thesis seeks to understand whether two independent algorithms, unaware of each other, learning from realized outcomes, end up implementing a deviation and punishment scheme to sustain collusion.
